              (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China has spread quickly nationwide. Here,
              we report results of a descriptive, exploratory analysis of all
              cases diagnosed as of February 11, 2020. Methods: All COVID-19
              cases reported through February 11, 2020 were extracted from
              China's Infectious Disease Information System. Analyses included:
              1) summary of patient characteristics; 2) examination of age
              distributions and sex ratios; 3) calculation of case fatality and
              mortality rates; 4) geo-temporal analysis of viral spread; 5)
              epidemiological curve construction; and 6) subgroup analysis.
              Results: A total of 72 314 patient records-44 672 (61.8\%)
              confirmed cases, 16 186 (22.4\%) suspected cases, 10567 (14.6\%)
              clinical diagnosed cases (Hubei only), and 889 asymptomatic cases
              (1.2\%)-contributed data for the analysis. Among confirmed cases,
              most were aged 30-79 years (86.6\%), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7\%),
              and considered mild/mild pneumonia (80.9\%). A total of 1 023
              deaths occurred among confirmed cases for an overall
              case-fatality rate of 2.3\%. The COVID-19 spread outward from
              Hubei sometime after December 2019 and by February 11, 2020, 1
              386 counties across all 31 provinces were affected. The epidemic
              curve of onset of symptoms peaked in January 23-26, then began to
              decline leading up to February 11. A total of 1 716 health
              workers have become infected and 5 have died (0.3\%).
              Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic has spread very quickly. It
              only took 30 days to expand from Hubei to the rest of Mainland
              China. With many people returning from a long holiday, China
              needs to prepare for the possible rebound of the epidemic.",

               (COVID-19) caused 82 623 confirmed cases and 2858 deaths
               globally, more than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
               (8273 cases, 775 deaths) and Middle East respiratory syndrome
               (MERS) (1139 cases, 431 deaths) caused in 2003 and 2013,
               respectively. COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries
               internationally. Total fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated at
               3.46\% by far based on published data from the Chinese Center
               for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). Average
               incubation period of COVID-19 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0
               to 24 days. The basic reproductive number (R0 ) of COVID-19
               ranges from 2 to 3.5 at the early phase regardless of different
               prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS. A study
               from China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9\%) were
               considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large
               amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed
               enormous challenges for containing the spread of COVID-19.
               Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem. A total of
               3019 health workers were infected by 12 February 2020, which
               accounted for 3.83\% of total number of infections, and
               extremely burdened the health system, especially in Wuhan.
               Limited epidemiological and clinical data suggest that the
               disease spectrum of COVID-19 may differ from SARS or MERS. We
               summarize latest literatures on genetic, epidemiological, and
               clinical features of COVID-19 in comparison to SARS and MERS and
               emphasize special measures on diagnosis and potential
               interventions. This review will improve our understanding of the

               of COVID-19 patients until March 20, 2020 were retrieved from
               four databases. We statistically analyzed the risk factors of

               Meta-analysis, including a total number of 3027 patients with

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China,
               was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel
               coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the epidemiological,
               clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and
               treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. METHODS: All
               patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated
               hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data
               on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by
               real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were
               obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO
               and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging
               Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.
               Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their
               families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes
               were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the
               intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. FINDINGS: By
               Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified
               as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the
               infected patients were men (30 [73\%] of 41); less than half had
               underlying diseases (13 [32\%]), including diabetes (eight
               [20\%]), hypertension (six [15\%]), and cardiovascular disease
               (six [15\%]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0-58·0). 27
               (66\%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.
               One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of
               illness were fever (40 [98\%] of 41 patients), cough (31
               [76\%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44\%]); less common
               symptoms were sputum production (11 [28\%] of 39), headache
               (three [8\%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5\%] of 39), and
               diarrhoea (one [3\%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55\%) of
               40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days
               [IQR 5·0-13·0]). 26 (63\%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All
               41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.
               Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12
               [29\%]), RNAaemia (six [15\%]), acute cardiac injury (five
               [12\%]) and secondary infection (four [10\%]). 13 (32\%)
               patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15\%) died. Compared
               with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of
               IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF$\alpha$.
               INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of
               severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory
               syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and
               high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin,
               epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical
               spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies. FUNDING:

              progression to disease is significantly slower than that of human
              immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Genetic determinants for
              susceptibility to disease progression were hypothesized to play a
              more significant role in this infection compared with HIV-1. We
              sought to identify common human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) alleles
              in the Senegalese population and to compare HLA profiles between
              HIV-2-infected individuals with low and high risk for disease
              progression. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: We conducted a case-control
              study investigating possible associations between MHC class I
              genes and the risk of disease progression in HIV-2-infected
              individuals. The MHC class I genotype was molecularly defined
              using polymerase chain reaction with sequence specific primers
              (PCR-SSP) in 62 female sex workers from the Dakar, Senegal
              cohort. Lack of antibodies to the HIV-2 antigen p26 has been
              previously shown to predict disease progression and was used in
              this study as a surrogate marker. Twenty-one cases were
              identified lacking antibodies to p26, therefore at a higher risk
              of disease progression, and were compared with 41 p26
              antibody-positive, randomly selected controls. RESULTS:
              Statistical analysis showed that HLA B35 was significantly
              associated with lack of p26 antibodies, and higher risk of
              disease progression ( < 0.05). The same association was found for
              the self-defined class I haplotypes B35-Cw4 and A23-Cw 7 ( <
              0.05). The HLA B 53 allele was associated with slower disease
              progression; however, this association was not statistically
              significant. We observed a trend whereby heterozygotes were at
              lower risk for HIV-2 disease progression, as previously reported
              in HIV-1 disease. CONCLUSIONS: In this West African population, a
              distinct profile of HLA class I alleles was observed, and many of
              these appear to influence disease progression in HIV-2 infection.",

              To define host genetic effects on the outcome of a chronic viral

              >300 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms

  abstract  = "Host gene variants may influence the natural history of
               hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The human leukocyte antigen
               (HLA) system, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in
               humans, is one of the most important host factors that are
               correlated with the clinical course of HBV infection.
               Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have shown that single
               nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near certain HLA gene loci are
               strongly associated with not only persistent HBV infection but
               also spontaneous HBV clearance and seroconversion, disease
               progression, and the development of liver cirrhosis and
               HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis
               B (CHB). These variations also influence the efficacy of
               interferon (IFN) and nucleot(s)ide analogue (NA) treatment and
               response to HBV vaccines. Meanwhile, discrepant conclusions were
               reached with different patient cohorts. It is therefore
               essential to identify the associations of specific HLA allele
               variants with disease progression and viral clearance in chronic
               HBV infection among different ethnic populations. A better
               understanding of HLA polymorphism relevance in HBV infection
               outcome would enable us to elucidate the roles of HLA SNPs in
               the pathogenesis and clearance of HBV in different areas and
               ethnic groups, to improve strategies for the prevention and
               treatment of chronic HBV infection.",

               of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may be influenced by the
               host genetic factor. The aim of this study was to investigate
               whether particular human leukocytes antigen (HLA) molecules are
               associated with the susceptibility to HCV infection in the
               Korean population. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-seven
               patients with chronic HCV infection and 206 normal individuals
               were examined for HLA class I and II molecules. RESULTS: In
               class I antigens, the frequencies of HLA-A3 (relative risk
               (RR)=3.5, P<0.04), HLA-B35 (RR=2.0, P<0.03), and HLA-B46
               (RR=2.5, P<0.02) significantly increased in chronic HCV carriers
               compared with the controls. The frequencies of DRB1*0803,
               DQB1*0601 and DQB1*0604 were significantly higher in chronic HCV
               carriers than in controls (RR=2.5, P<0.005; RR=1.8, P<0.05;
               RR=1.9, P<0.04, respectively). On the other hand, the
               frequencies of DRB1*0301, DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0201 were
               significantly lower in chronic HCV carriers than in normal
               controls (RR=0.2, P<0.03; RR=0.4, P<0.004; RR=0.5, P<0.02,
               respectively). The haplotype DRB1*0803-DQB1*0601 significantly
               increased (RR=2.5, P<0.02) while the DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201
               significantly decreased (RR=0.2, P<0.03) in chronic HCV carriers
               compared with normal controls. In stratification analysis to
               investigate the interrelationships among the associated alleles,
               DRB1*0803 and DQB1*0601 were associated with HLA-B46,
               particularly in patients with chronic HCV carriers. CONCLUSIONS:
               These results suggest that particular HLA alleles may have an

               activated DCs might potentially present cell-associated Ags
               derived from captured dead cells. In this study, we find that
               human DCs that captured dead cells containing the TLR3 agonist
               poly(I:C) produced cytokines and underwent maturation, but
               failed to elicit autologous CD8(+) T cell responses against Ags
               of dead cells. Accordingly, DCs that captured dead cells
               containing poly(I:C), or influenza virus, are unable to activate
               CD8(+) T cell clones specific to cell-associated Ags of captured
               dead cells. CD4(+) T cells are expanded with DCs that have
               captured poly(I:C)-containing dead cells, indicating the
               inhibition is specific for MHC class I-restricted
               cross-presentation. Furthermore, these DCs can expand naive
               allogeneic CD8(+) T cells. Finally, soluble or targeted Ag is
               presented when coloaded onto DCs that have captured
               poly(I:C)-containing dead cells, indicating the inhibition is
               specific for dead cell cargo that is accompanied by viral or
               poly(I:C) stimulus. Thus, DCs have a mechanism that prevents MHC

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is widely
              used as a strategy in the search for the etiology of infectious
              diseases and autoimmune disorders. During the Taiwan epidemic of
              severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), many health care
              workers were infected. In an effort to establish a screening
              program for high risk personal, the distribution of HLA class I
              and II alleles in case and control groups was examined for the
              presence of an association to a genetic susceptibly or resistance
              to SARS coronavirus infection. METHODS: HLA-class I and II allele
              typing by PCR-SSOP was performed on 37 cases of probable SARS, 28
              fever patients excluded later as probable SARS, and 101
              non-infected health care workers who were exposed or possibly
              exposed to SARS coronavirus. An additional control set of 190
              normal healthy unrelated Taiwanese was also used in the analysis.
              RESULTS: Woolf and Haldane Odds ratio (OR) and corrected P-value
              (Pc) obtained from two tails Fisher exact test were used to show
              susceptibility of HLA class I or class II alleles with
              coronavirus infection. At first, when analyzing infected SARS
              patients and high risk health care workers groups, HLA-B*4601 (OR
              = 2.08, P = 0.04, Pc = n.s.) and HLA-B*5401 (OR = 5.44, P = 0.02,
              Pc = n.s.) appeared as the most probable elements that may be
              favoring SARS coronavirus infection. After selecting only a
              ``severe cases'' patient group from the infected ``probable
              SARS'' patient group and comparing them with the high risk health
              care workers group, the severity of SARS was shown to be
              significantly associated with HLA-B*4601 (P = 0.0008 or Pc =
              0.0279). CONCLUSIONS: Densely populated regions with genetically
              related southern Asian populations appear to be more affected by
              the spreading of SARS infection. Up until recently, no probable
              SARS patients were reported among Taiwan indigenous peoples who
              are genetically distinct from the Taiwanese general population,
              have no HLA-B* 4601 and have high frequency of HLA-B* 1301. While
              increase of HLA-B* 4601 allele frequency was observed in the
              ``Probable SARS infected'' patient group, a further significant
              increase of the allele was seen in the ``Severe cases'' patient
              group. These results appeared to indicate association of HLA-B*
              4601 with the severity of SARS infection in Asian populations.

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: In late December, 2019, patients presenting with
               viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were
               reported in Wuhan, China. A novel coronavirus was subsequently
               identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019
               novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than
               2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of
               which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and
               human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. METHODS: We did
               next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar
               lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight
               of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete
               and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these
               individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger
               sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal
               regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.
               Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of
               other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary
               history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology
               modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding
               properties of the virus. FINDINGS: The ten genome sequences of
               2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely
               similar, exhibiting more than 99·98\% sequence identity.
               Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88\% identity) to
               two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like
               coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in
               2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from
               SARS-CoV (about 79\%) and MERS-CoV (about 50\%). Phylogenetic
               analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus
               Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively
               long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and
               bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.
               Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a
               similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV,
               despite amino acid variation at some key residues.
               INTERPRETATION: 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from
               SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.
               Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be
               the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood
               market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host
               facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly,
               structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to
               bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.
               The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus
               warrant urgent investigation. FUNDING: National Key Research and

               (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been increasing urgency to
               identify pathophysiological characteristics leading to severe
               clinical course in patients infected with severe acute
               respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human leukocyte
               antigen alleles (HLA) have been suggested as potential genetic
               host factors that affect individual immune response to

               a multicenter study using HLA sequencing. METHODS: We analyzed

               individuals from Germany (n = 135), Spain (n = 133), Switzerland

               HLA-C*04:01 had twice the risk of intubation when infected with
               SARS-CoV-2 (risk ratio 1.5 [95\% CI 1.1-2.1], odds ratio 3.5
               [95\% CI 1.9-6.6], adjusted p-value = 0.0074). These findings
               are based on data from four countries and corroborated by
               independent results from GWAS. Our findings are biologically
               plausible, as HLA-C*04:01 has fewer predicted bindings sites for
               relevant SARS-CoV-2 peptides compared to other HLA alleles.
               INTERPRETATION: HLA-C*04:01 carrier state is associated with
               severe clinical course in SARS-CoV-2. Our findings suggest that
               HLA class I alleles have a relevant role in immune defense
               against SARS-CoV-2. FUNDING: Funded by Roche Sequencing

               and laboratory manifestations and disease severity. Nonetheless,

               varying levels of severity from the Shenzhen Third People's
               Hospital. Upon a total of 22.2 million genetic variants, we
               conducted both single-variant and gene-based association tests
               among five severity groups including asymptomatic, mild,

               hypothesised that differences in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
               genes might influence this variation. Using next generation
               sequencing, we analysed the class I and class II classical HLA
               genes of 147 individuals of European descent experiencing
               variable clinical outcomes following COVID-19 infection.
               Forty-nine of these patients were admitted to hospital with
               severe respiratory disease. They had no significant pre-existing
               comorbidities. We compared the results to those obtained from a

               and national healthy controls with adjustments made for age and
               sex. With the inclusion of hospital staff who had reported
               localised symptoms only (limited to loss of smell/taste, n = 13)
               or systemic symptoms not requiring hospital treatment (n = 16),
               we carried out ordinal logistic regression modelling to
               determine the relative influence of age, BMI, sex and the

               (5.1\% vs. 16.7\%, P = .003 after adjustment for age and sex).

               influence of DRB1*04:01 on the clinical severity of COVID-19
               observed in the cohorts. These alleles are found in greater
               frequencies in the North Western European population. This

               asymptomatic or mild infection to a critical or fatal disease.
               Several host factors such as elderly age, male gender, and
               previous comorbidities seem to be involved in the most severe
               outcomes, but also an impaired immune response that causes a
               hyperinflammatory state but is unable to clear the infection. In
               order to get further understanding about this impaired immune
               response, we aimed to determine the association of specific HLA
               alleles with different clinical presentations of COVID-19.
               Therefore, we analyzed HLA Class I and II, as well as KIR gene
               sequences, in 72 individuals with Spanish Mediterranean
               Caucasian ethnicity who presented mild, severe, or critical
               COVID-19, according to their clinical characteristics and
               management. This cohort was recruited in Madrid (Spain) during
               the first and second pandemic waves between April and October
               2020. There were no significant differences in HLA-A or HLA-B
               alleles among groups. However, despite the small sample size, we
               found that HLA-C alleles from group C1 HLA-C*08:02, -C*12:03, or
               -C*16:01 were more frequently associated in individuals with
               mild COVID-19 (43.8\%) than in individuals with severe (8.3\%; p
               = 0.0030; pc = 0.033) and critical (16.1\%; p = 0.0014; pc =
               0.0154) disease. C1 alleles are supposed to be highly efficient
               to present peptides to T cells, and HLA-C*12:03 may present a
               high number of verified epitopes from abundant SARS-CoV-2
               proteins M, N, and S, thereby being allegedly able to trigger an
               efficient antiviral response. On the contrary, C2 alleles are
               usually poorly expressed on the cell surface due to low
               association with $\beta$2-microglobulin ($\beta$2M) and
               peptides, which may impede the adequate formation of stable
               HLA-C/$\beta$2M/peptide heterotrimers. Consequently, this pilot

               outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory
               Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need
               to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to
               control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights
               for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high
               genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused
               the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological
               studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined
               SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic
               structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell
               and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid
               (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no
               mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among
               the 120 available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020),
               immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer
               protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we
               performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC
               alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to
               provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our

               has posed a serious global health threat. According to the
               latest report (18-February-2020), it has infected more than
               72,000 people globally and led to deaths of more than 1,016
               people in China. Methods: The 2019 novel coronavirus proteome
               was aligned to a curated database of viral immunogenic peptides.
               The immunogenicity of detected peptides and their binding
               potential to HLA alleles was predicted by immunogenicity
               predictive models and NetMHCpan 4.0. Results: We report in
               silico identification of a comprehensive list of immunogenic
               peptides that can be used as potential targets for 2019 novel
               coronavirus (2019-nCoV) vaccine development. First, we found 28
               nCoV peptides identical to Severe acute respiratory
               syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS CoV) that have previously
               been characterized immunogenic by T cell assays. Second, we
               identified 48 nCoV peptides having a high degree of similarity
               with immunogenic peptides deposited in The Immune Epitope
               Database (IEDB). Lastly, we conducted a de novo search of
               2019-nCoV 9-mer peptides that i) bind to common HLA alleles in
               Chinese and European population and ii) have T Cell Receptor

               predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that
               individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to

               capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that
               are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting that it
               could enable cross-protective T-cell-based immunity. Finally, we
               reported global distributions of HLA types with potential
               epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current
               pandemic.IMPORTANCE Individual genetic variation may help to
               explain different immune responses to a virus across a
               population. In particular, understanding how variation in HLA
               may affect the course of COVID-19 could help identify
               individuals at higher risk from the disease. HLA typing can be
               fast and inexpensive. Pairing HLA typing with COVID-19 testing
               where feasible could improve assessment of severity of viral
               disease in the population. Following the development of a
               vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19,
               individuals with high-risk HLA types could be prioritized for

               that can potentially trigger both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell immune
               responses and investigated its biological activities by
               computational tools. Three known antigenic proteins
               (Nucleocapsid, ORF3a, and Membrane protein, hereafter called
               NOM) from the virus were selected and analyzed for prediction of

               global pandemic, putting at risk not only the global healthcare
               system, but also the world economy. As the disease continues to
               spread rapidly, the development of prophylactic and therapeutic
               approaches is urgently required. Although some progress has been
               made in understanding the viral structure and invasion mechanism
               of coronaviruses that may cause severe cases of the syndrome,
               due to the limited understanding of the immune effects caused by
               SARS-CoV-2, it is difficult for us to prevent patients from
               developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and
               pulmonary fibrosis (PF), the major complications of coronavirus
               infection. Therefore, any potential treatments should focus not
               only on direct killing of coronaviruses and prevention
               strategies by vaccine development, but also on keeping in check
               the acute immune/inflammatory responses, resulting in ARDS and
               PF. In addition, potential treatments currently under clinical
               trials focusing on killing coronaviruses or on developing
               vaccines preventing coronavirus infection largely ignore the
               host immune response. However, taking care of SARS-CoV-2
               infected patients with ARDS and PF is considered to be the major
               difficulty. Therefore, further understanding of the host immune
               response to SARS-CoV-2 is extremely important for clinical
               resolution and saving medication cost. In addition to a breif
               overview of the structure, infection mechanism, and possible
               therapeutic approaches, we summarized and compared the
               hematopathologic effect and immune responses to SARS-CoV,
               MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. We also discussed the indirect immune
               response caused by SARS and direct infection, replication, and
               destroying of immune cells by MERS-CoV. The molecular mechanisms
               of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection-induced lymphopenia or
               cytokine storm may provide some hint toward fight against
               SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus. This may provide guidance

               Rottier, J. Virol. 72:6838-6850, 1998) were tested for the
               ability to associate with other M proteins and to be rescued
               into VLPs formed by assembly-competent M proteins. We found that
               M proteins lacking parts of the transmembrane cluster, of the

               or M proteins that had their luminal domain replaced by
               heterologous ectodomains, were still able to associate with
               assembly-competent M proteins, resulting in their
               coincorporation into VLPs. Only a mutant M protein in which all
               three transmembrane domains had been replaced lost this ability.
               The results indicate that M protein molecules interact with each
               other through multiple contact sites, particularly at the
               transmembrane level. Finally, we tested the stringency with
               which membrane proteins are selected for incorporation into the
               coronavirus envelope by probing the coassembly of some foreign

  abstract = "Viroporins are viral proteins with ion channel (IC) activity that
              play an important role in several processes, including virus
              replication and pathogenesis. While many coronaviruses (CoVs)
              encode two viroporins, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV
              (SARS-CoV) encodes three: proteins 3a, E, and 8a. Additionally,
              proteins 3a and E have a PDZ-binding motif (PBM), which can
              potentially bind over 400 cellular proteins which contain a PDZ
              domain, making them potentially important for the control of cell
              function. In the present work, a comparative study of the
              functional motifs included within the SARS-CoV viroporins was
              performed, mostly focusing on the roles of the IC and PBM of E
              and 3a proteins. Our results showed that the full-length E and 3a
              proteins were required for maximal SARS-CoV replication and
              virulence, whereas viroporin 8a had only a minor impact on these
              activities. A virus missing both the E and 3a proteins was not
              viable, whereas the presence of either protein with a functional
              PBM restored virus viability. E protein IC activity and the
              presence of its PBM were necessary for virulence in mice. In
              contrast, the presence or absence of the homologous motifs in
              protein 3a did not influence virus pathogenicity. Therefore,
              dominance of the IC and PBM of protein E over those of protein 3a
              was demonstrated in the induction of pathogenesis in
              mice.IMPORTANCE Collectively, these results demonstrate key roles
              for the ion channel and PBM domains in optimal virus replication
              and pathogenesis and suggest that the viral viroporins and PBMs
              are suitable targets for antiviral therapy and for mutation in
              attenuated SARS-CoV vaccines.",

  title     = "Distinctive polymorphism at the {HLA-C} locus: implications for
               the expression of {HLA-C}",
  author    = "Zemmour, J and Parham, P",
  abstract  = "The HLA-C locus remains an enigma. The serological polymorphism
               is poorly defined, HLA-C molecules are expressed at the cell
               surface at about 10\% the levels of HLA-A and -B, and their
               importance for antigen presentation to either CD8-bearing T
               cells or natural killer cells is unclear. Our understanding of
               HLA-C polymorphism has also lagged behind that of HLA-A and -B.
               We have applied the polymerase chain reaction to the
               characterization of cDNA encoding HLA-C antigens. Combining the
               recent results with previously characterized HLA-C alleles gives
               a data base of 26 sequences, which was used to analyze the
               nature of HLA-C polymorphism and compare it to the variation
               seen in HLA-A and -B. The sequences form 10 families of alleles
               that correlate well with the patterns of serological
               crossreactivity, including the C blanks, and all major HLA-C
               allelic families appear to have been sampled. The families
               further divide into two groups of HLA-C alleles defined on the
               basis of linked substitutions in the 3' exons. In comparison
               with HLA-A and -B, HLA-C alleles are more closely related to
               each other, there being less variation in residues of the
               antigen recognition site and more variation at other positions.
               In particular, the helix of the alpha 1 domain of HLA-C
               molecules is unusually conserved. Despite the reduced diversity
               in the antigen recognition site, it is evident that HLA-C genes
               have been the target of past selection for polymorphism. Within
               the antigen recognition site, it is the alpha 1 domain that is
               most diagnostic of HLA-C, whereas the alpha 2 domain is similar
               to that of HLA-B, the locus to which HLA-C is most closely
               related. In particular, conserved motifs in the alpha 1 helix
               and the conserved glycine at the base of the B pocket (position
               45) provide a combination of features that is uniquely found in
               HLA-C molecules. We hypothesize that these features restrict the
               peptides bound by HLA-C molecules and in this manner reduce the
               efficiency of HLA-C assembly and expression at the cell surface.
               The overall picture HLA-C polymorphism obtained from this
               sampling of HLA-C alleles is unlikely to change as further
               alleles are characterized.",

               extensively, little is known about HLA-C specificities.
               Combining a positional scanning combinatorial peptide library
               approach with a peptide-HLA-I dissociation assay, in this study

               strategy to 17 of the most common HLA-C molecules, and for 16 of
               these we successfully generated matrices representing their
               peptide-binding motifs. The motifs prominently shared a
               conserved C-terminal primary anchor with hydrophobic amino acid
               residues, as well as one or more diverse primary and auxiliary
               anchors at P1, P2, P3, and/or P7. Matrices were used to generate

               our pan-specific NetMHCpan predictor, whose predictive
               performance was considerably improved with respect to peptide
               binding to HLA-C. The updated predictor was used to assess the
               specificities of HLA-C molecules, which were found to cover a
               more limited sequence space than HLA-A and -B molecules.
               Assessing the functional significance of these new tools,
               HLA-C*07:01 transgenic mice were immunized with stable

               spread worldwide. Identifying poor prognostic factors is helpful
               for risk stratification. In this meta-analysis, we investigated
               the association between severe COVID-19 and a change in white
               blood cell (WBC) count, an elevation of C-reactive protein
               (CRP), and fever. Moreover, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic
               accuracy of leukocytosis and an elevation of CRP. METHODS: We
               performed a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the
               Cochrane Library through April 20th, 2020. The odds ratios (ORs)
               and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A
               sensitivity analysis was conducted according to the study size
               (>200 or 55 or <55). Meta-regression analyses were conducted to
               examine possible sources of heterogeneity. We calculated the
               diagnostic accuracy of leukocytosis and CRP. RESULTS: Eighteen
               studies with 3278 patients were selected. Fever, leukocytosis,
               and elevated CRP were associated with poor outcomes (OR (95\%
               CI) 1.63 (1.06-2.51), 4.51 (2.53-8.04), and 11.97 (4.97-28.8),
               respectively). Leukopenia was associated with a better prognosis
               (OR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.40-0.78). Sensitivity analyses showed
               similar tendencies. Meta-regression analysis for leukocytosis
               indicated that age, dyspnea, and hypertension contributed to
               heterogeneity. The pooled area under the leukocytosis and CRP
               curves were 0.70 (0.64-0.76) and 0.89 (0.80-0.99), respectively.
               CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19, fever, leukocytosis, and

               known to be involved in the immune response against infections,
               correlates with COVID-19 incidence. COVID-19 data were provided
               by the National Civil Protection Department, whereas HLA allele
               prevalence was retrieved through the Italian Bone-Marrow Donors
               Registry. Among all the alleles, HLA-A*25, B*08, B*44, B*15:01,
               B*51, C*01, and C*03 showed a positive log-linear correlation

               coefficients between -0.47 and -0.59, p-value < 0.0001). When
               alleles were examined simultaneously using a multiple regression
               model to control for confounding factors, HLA-B*44 and C*01 were

               Several aspects of its pathogenesis and the related clinical
               consequences still need elucidation. In Italy, Sardinia has had
               very low numbers of infections. Taking advantage of the low
               genetic polymorphism in the Sardinian population, we analyzed
               clinical, genetic and immunogenetic factors, with particular
               attention to HLA class I and II molecules, to evaluate their
               influence on susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the
               clinical outcome. Method and Materials: We recruited 619 healthy
               Sardinian controls and 182 SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thirty-nine
               patients required hospital care and 143 were without symptoms,
               pauci-symptomatic or with mild disease. For all participants, we
               collected demographic and clinical data and analyzed the HLA
               allele and haplotype frequencies. Results: Male sex and older
               age were more frequent in hospitalized patients, none of whom
               had been vaccinated during the previous seasonal flu vaccination
               campaignes. Compared to the group of asymptomatic or
               pauci-symptomatic patients, hospitalized patients also had a
               higher frequency of autoimmune diseases and
               glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PDH) deficiency. None of
               these patients carried the beta-thalassemia trait, a relatively
               common finding in the Sardinian population. The extended
               haplotype HLA-A*02:05, B*58:01, C*07:01, DRB1*03:01 [OR 0.1
               (95\% CI 0-0.6), Pc = 0.015] was absent in all 182 patients,
               while the HLA-C*04:01 allele and the three-loci haplotype
               HLA-A*30:02, B*14:02, C*08:02 [OR 3.8 (95\% CI 1.8-8.1), Pc =
               0.025] were more frequently represented in patients than
               controls. In a comparison between in-patients and home care
               patients, the HLA-DRB1*08:01 allele was exclusively present in
               the hospitalized patients [OR > 2.5 (95\% CI 2.7-220.6), Pc =
               0.024]. Conclusion: The data emerging from our study suggest
               that the extended haplotype HLA-A*02:05, B*58:01, C*07:01,
               DRB1*03:01 has a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection
               in the Sardinian population. Genetic factors that resulted to
               have a negative influence on the disease course were presence of
               the HLA-DRB1*08:01 allele and G6PDH deficiency, but not the
               beta-thalassemic trait. Absence of influenza vaccination could
               be a predisposing factor for more severe disease.",

               fundamental role in human immunity, and it is established that
               certain HLA alleles are disease determinants. Previously, we

               including DPA1*02:02, in two small patient cohorts at the
               COVID-19 pandemic onset. METHODS: We have since analyzed a
               larger public patient cohort data (n = 126 patients) with
               controls, associated demographic and clinical data. By combining
               the predictive power of multiple in silico HLA predictors, we
               report on HLA-I and HLA-II alleles, along with their associated
               risk significance. RESULTS: We observe HLA-II DPA1*02:02 at a
               higher frequency in the COVID-19 positive cohort (29\%) when
               compared to the COVID-negative control group (Fisher's exact
               test [FET] p = 0.0174). Having this allele, however, does not
               appear to put this cohort's patients at an increased risk of
               hospitalization. Inspection of COVID-19 disease severity
               outcomes, including admission to intensive care, reveal
               nominally significant risk associations with A*11:01 (FET p =
               0.0078) and C*04:01 (FET p = 0.0087). The association with
               severe disease outcome is especially evident for patients with
               C*04:01, where disease prognosis measured by mechanical
               ventilation-free days was statistically significant after
               multiple hypothesis correction (Bonferroni p = 0.0323). While
               prevalence of some of these alleles falls below statistical
               significance after Bonferroni correction, COVID-19 patients with
               HLA-I C*04:01 tend to fare worse overall. This HLA allele may

               structurally homologous to the HLA-A and B antigens as judged by
               various criteria. Each antigen comprised a glycosylated
               polypeptide of 43 000 molecular weight that is noncovalently
               associated with beta2-microglobulin (beta2m). Some small
               differences in molecular parameters were, however, revealed.
               Thus, the deoxycholate-solubilized HLA-CW2 antigen sedimented at
               the same rate as the HLA-A antigens but at a slightly faster
               rate than the HLA-B antigens. This variation is apparently is
               apparently due to different amounts of bound deoxycholate. Also,

               This difference reflects some structural heterogeneity in the

               the single N-linked glycan to this process were examined. We
               observed a requirement for N-linked glycosylation in the proper

               particular, although considerable variation was seen within the

               single N-linked glycan can contribute in a major way to that
               conformation of the heavy (H) chain which is competent to
               associate with the light chain beta 2-microglobulin, and that
               the presence, rather than the type, of carbohydrate chain is
               important in this respect. The association of human class I H

               an initially rapid phase is followed by a prolonged period

               how protein-protein interactions during assembly and regulation

               find that intrinsic properties of the HLA-C heavy chain proteins
               do not correlate with low cell surface expression: HLA-C heavy
               chains associate and dissociate with beta 2-microglobulin (beta
               2m) at rates comparable to those found for HLA-A and -B, and
               increased competition for beta 2m does not alter the surface
               expression of HLA-C. From studies of chimeric genes spliced from
               the HLA-B7 and -Cw3 genes, we find that chimeric proteins
               containing the B7 peptide-binding groove can have low cell
               surface expression, suggesting that inefficiency in binding
               peptides is not the cause of low cell surface expression for

               Epidemiological and functional studies have recently suggested
               that NK cells can also contribute to the control of HIV-1
               infection through recognition of virally infected cells by both

               Here we describe KIR-associated amino-acid polymorphisms in the
               HIV-1 sequence of chronically infected individuals, on a
               population level. We show that these KIR-associated HIV-1

               KIRs to HIV-1-infected CD4(+) T cells, and reduce the antiviral

               Killer (NK) cells in the control of HIV-1 infection. Recently,
               it was shown that NK cell-mediated immune pressure can result in
               the selection of HIV-1 escape mutations. A potential mechanism
               for this NK cell escape is the selection of HLA class
               I-presented HIV-1 epitopes that allow for the engagement of
               inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs),
               notably KIR2DL2. We therefore investigated the consequences of
               sequence variations within HLA-Cw*0102-restricted epitopes on
               the interaction of HLA-Cw*0102 with KIR2DL2 using a large panel
               of overlapping HIV-1 p24 Gag peptides. 217 decameric peptides
               spanning the HIV-1 p24 Gag consensus sequence were screened for
               HLA-Cw*0102 stabilization by co-incubation with
               Cw*0102⁺/TAP-deficient T2 cells using a flow cytometry-based
               assay. KIR2DL2 binding was assessed using a KIR2DL2-IgG fusion
               construct. Function of KIR2DL2⁺ NK cells was flow cytometrically
               analyzed by measuring degranulation of primary NK cells after
               co-incubation with peptide-pulsed T2 cells. We identified 11
               peptides stabilizing HLA-Cw*0102 on the surface of T2 cells.
               However, only one peptide (p24 Gag₂₀₉₋₂₁₈ AAEWDRLHPV) allowed
               for binding of KIR2DL2. Notably, functional analysis showed a
               significant inhibition of KIR2DL2⁺ NK cells in the presence of
               p24 Gag₂₀₉₋₂₁₈-pulsed T2 cells, while degranulation of KIR2DL2⁻
               NK cells was not affected. Moreover, we demonstrated that
               sequence variations in position 7 of this epitope observed
               frequently in naturally occurring HIV-1 sequences can modulate
               binding to KIR2DL2. Our results show that the majority of HIV-1
               p24 Gag peptides stabilizing HLA-Cw*0102 do not allow for
               binding of KIR2DL2, but identified one HLA-Cw*0102-presented
               peptide (p24 Gag₂₀₉₋₂₁₈) that was recognized by the inhibitory
               NK cell receptor KIR2DL2 leading to functional inhibition of
               KIR2DL2-expressing NK cells. Engagement of KIR2DL2 might protect
               virus-infected cells from NK cell-mediated lysis and selections

              sought to understand the mechanisms by which natural killer (NK)
              cells recognize HIV-1-infected cells and how this virus can evade
              NK-cell-mediated immune pressure. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Two
              sequence mutations in p24 Gag associated with the presence of
              specific KIR/HLA combined genotypes were identified in HIV-1
              clade C viruses from a large cohort of infected, untreated
              individuals in South Africa (n = 392), suggesting viral escape
              from KIR+ NK cells through sequence variations within HLA class
              I-presented epitopes. One sequence polymorphism at position 303
              of p24 Gag (TGag303V), selected for in infected individuals with
              both KIR2DL3 and HLA-C*03:04, enabled significantly better
              binding of the inhibitory KIR2DL3 receptor to
              HLA-C*03:04-expressing cells presenting this variant epitope
              compared to the wild-type epitope (wild-type mean 18.01 $\pm$

              SD, p = 0.002). Furthermore, activation of primary KIR2DL3+ NK
              cells from healthy donors in response to HLA-C*03:04+ target
              cells presenting the variant epitope was significantly reduced in
              comparison to cells presenting the wild-type sequence (wild-type
              mean 0.78 $\pm$ 0.07 standard error of the mean [SEM] and variant
              mean 0.63 $\pm$ 0.07 SEM, p = 0.012). Structural modeling and
              surface plasmon resonance of KIR/peptide/HLA interactions in the
              context of the different viral sequence variants studied
              supported these results. Future studies will be needed to assess
              processing and antigen presentation of the investigated HIV-1
              epitope in natural infection, and the consequences for viral
              control. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide novel insights into how
              viruses can evade NK cell immunity through the selection of
              mutations in HLA-presented epitopes that enhance binding to
              inhibitory NK cell receptors. Better understanding of the

              epitopes on binding of the inhibitory natural killer (NK) cell
              receptor KIR2DL2 to HLA-C03:04. DESIGN: HIV-1 may possibly evade
              recognition by KIR+ NK cells through selection of sequence
              variants that interfere with the interactions of inhibitory
              killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and their target
              ligands on HIV-1 infected cells. KIR2DL2 is an inhibitory NK cell
              receptor that binds to a family of HLA-C ligands. Here, we
              investigated whether HIV-1 encodes for HLA-C03:04-restricted
              epitopes that alter KIR2DL2 binding. METHODS: Tapasin-deficient
              721.220 cells expressing HLA-C03:04 were pulsed with overlapping
              peptides (10mers overlapped by nine amino acids, spanning the
              entire HIV-1 p24 Gag sequence) to identify peptides that
              stabilized HLA-C expression. The impact that sequence variation
              in HLA-C03:04-binding HIV-1 epitopes has on KIR2DL2 binding and
              KIR2DL2+ NK cell function was determined using KIR2DL2-Fc
              constructs and NK cell degranulation assays. RESULTS: Several
              novel HLA-C03:04 binding epitopes were identified within the
              HIV-1 p24 Gag consensus sequence. Three of these consensus
              sequence peptides (Gag144-152, Gag163-171 and Gag295-304) enabled
              binding of KIR2DL2 to HLA-C03:04 and resulted in inhibition of
              KIR2DL2+ primary NK cells. Furthermore, naturally occurring minor
              variants of epitope Gag295-304 enhanced KIR2DL2 binding to
              HLA-C03:04. CONCLUSION: Our data show that naturally occurring
              sequence variations within HLA-C03:04-restricted HIV-1 p24 Gag
              epitopes can have a significant impact on the binding of
              inhibitory KIR receptors and primary NK cell function.",

              investigated 504 anti-retroviral (ART)-free Japanese patients

              repertoires available for presentation by HLA-I. Alterations in
              HLA-I/peptide complexes can modulate binding of killer
              immunoglobuline-like receptors (KIRs) and thereby the function of
              natural killer (NK) cells. Although multiple studies have
              provided evidence that HLA-I/KIR interactions play a role in
              HIV-1 disease progression, the consequence of HIV-1 infection for
              HLA-I/KIR interactions remain largely unknown. DESIGN: We
              determined changes in HLA-I presented peptides resulting from
              HIV-1-infection of primary human CD4 T cells and assessed the
              impact of changes in peptide repertoires on HLA-I/KIR
              interactions. METHODS: Liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass
              spectrometry to identify HLA-I presented peptides, cell-based
              in-vitro assays to evaluate functional consequences of
              alterations in immunopeptidome and atomistic molecular dynamics
              simulations to confirm experimental data. RESULTS: A total of 583
              peptides exclusively presented on HIV-1-infected cells were
              identified, of which only 0.2\% represented HIV-1 derived
              peptides. Focusing on HLA-C*03 : 04/KIR2DL3 interactions, we
              observed that HLA-C*03 : 04-presented peptides derived from
              noninfected CD4 T cells mediated stronger binding of inhibitory
              KIR2DL3 than peptides derived from HIV-1-infected cells.
              Furthermore, the most abundant peptide presented by HLA-C*03 : 04
              on noninfected CD4 T cells (VIYPARISL) mediated the strongest
              KIR2DL3-binding, while the most abundant peptide presented on
              HIV-1-infected cells (YAIQATETL) did not mediate KIR2DL3-binding.
              Molecular dynamics simulations of HLA-C*03 : 04/KIR2DL3
              interactions in the context of these two peptides revealed that
              VIYPARISL significantly enhanced the HLA-C*03 : 04/peptide
              contact area to KIR2DL3 compared with YAIQATETL. CONCLUSION:
              These data demonstrate that HIV-1 infection-induced changes in

              leukocyte antigen (HLA)/killer cell immunoglobulin like receptor
              (KIR) interactions have been shown to play an important role in
              the control, clearance and progression of hepatitis C virus (HCV)
              disease. Here we aimed at elucidating the effects of viral
              peptides derived from HCV on HLA stabilization, changes in KIR
              binding and primary NK cell function. METHODS: Transporter for
              antigen presentation-deficient 722.221 cells stably transfected
              with HLA-C*03:04 were used to screen 200 overlapping peptides,
              covering the non-structural protein 3 (NS3) and core protein of
              HCV genotype 1, for their ability to bind and stabilize
              HLA-C*03:04. Binding of KIR2DL3 to the HLA-peptide complex was
              assessed using a KIR2DL3-IgG fusion construct. Primary NK cells
              were isolated from healthy donors to investigate the effects of
              identified peptides on KIR2DL3(+) NK cell function. RESULTS:
              Thirty-one peptides able to stabilize HLA-C*03:04 were
              identified. One 9mer peptide, YIPLVGAPL, resulted in
              significantly higher KIR2DL3 binding to HLA-C*03:04(+) 722.221
              cells and suppression of primary KIR2DL3(+) NK cell function.
              Interestingly this sequence exhibited a high frequency of
              mutations in different HCV genotypes. These genotype-specific
              peptides showed lower HLA-C*03:04 stabilization, decreased
              binding of the inhibitory KIR2DL3 and lower inhibition of NK cell
              function. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together we show that a viral
              peptide derived from the core protein of HCV genotype 1 binding
              to HLA-C*03:04 results in a sequence-dependent engagement of the
              inhibitory NK cell receptor KIR2DL3, while the large majority of
              the remaining 30 HLA-C*03:04 binding HCV core peptides did not.
              These data show that sequence variations within HCV can modulate
              NK cell function, providing potential pathways for viral escape.
              LAY SUMMARY: We identified a HCV peptide that dampens NK cell
              responses, and thereby possibly prevents killing of infected
              cells through this part of the innate immune system. This is
              facilitated via presentation of the viral peptide on HLA*03:04 to
              the inhibitory KIR receptor KIR2DL3 on NK cells. Naturally
              occurring sequence mutations in the peptide alter these
              interactions making the inhibition less efficient.",

               limiting MHC-I cell surface expression, is used by many viruses
               to evade immune recognition. In particular, downregulation of
               MHC-I molecules at the cell surface can reduce the ability of
               CD8+ T cells to recognize viral peptides presented by MHC-I
               molecules and thereby delay viral clearance by CD8+ T cells. To
               date, MHC-I downregulation by influenza viruses has not been
               reported. Given that influenza virus infections are a global
               health concern and that CD8+ T cells play an important role in
               promoting influenza virus clearance and recovery from influenza
               disease, we investigated whether influenza A and B viruses (IAV,
               IBV) downregulated MHC-I as a novel mechanism to evade cellular
               immunity. Here, we showed that infection of several cell types,
               including epithelial A549 cells, with a panel of IAV and IBV
               viruses downregulated the surface MHC-I expression on
               IAV/IBV-infected cells during the late stages of influenza virus
               infection in vitro. This observation was consistent across a
               panel of class I-reduced (C1R) cell lines expressing 14
               different HLA-A or -B alleles and a panel of 721.221 cell lines
               expressing 11 HLA-C alleles. Interestingly, IBV infection caused
               more pronounced reduction in surface MHC-I expression compared
               to IAV. Importantly, the two viruses utilized two distinct
               mechanisms for MHC-I downregulation. Our data demonstrated that
               while IAV caused a global loss of MHC-I within
               influenza-infected cells, IBV infection resulted in the
               preferential loss of MHC-I molecules from the cell surface,
               consequent of delayed MHC-I trafficking to the cell surface,
               resulting from retaining MHC-I intracellularly during IBV
               infection. Overall, our study suggests that influenza viruses
               across both IAV and IBV subtypes have the potential to
               downregulate MHC-I surface expression levels. Our findings
               provide new insights into the host-pathogen interaction of

               evidence indicates that the innate immune response plays a role

               transient clonal expansion of NK cells that coexpress CD94/NKG2C
               and inhibitory receptors for HLA-C1 alleles and are correlated

               early stages of the immune response against viral infections.
               Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) expressed on the
               surface of NK cells play an important role in regulating NK cell
               response through recognition of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
               class I molecules on target cells. Previous studies have shown
               that specific KIR/ligand combinations are associated with the
               outcome of several viral infectious diseases. METHODS: We
               investigated the impact of inhibitory and activating KIR and
               their HLA-class I ligand genotype on the susceptibility to
               Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV2) infections.
               From April to July 2010 in Gabon, a large outbreak of CHIKV and
               DENV2 concomitantly occurred in two provinces of Gabon
               (Ogoou{\'e}-Lolo and Haut-Ogoou{\'e}). We performed the
               genotypic analysis of KIR in the combination with their cognate
               HLA-class I ligands in 73 CHIKV and 55 DENV2 adult cases,
               compared with 54 healthy individuals. RESULTS: We found in
               CHIV-infected patients that KIR2DL1 and KIR2DS5 are
               significantly increased and decreased respectively, as compared
               to DENV2+ patients and healthy donors. The combination of
               KIR2DL1 and its cognate HLA-C2 ligand was significantly
               associated with the susceptibility to CHIKV infection. In
               contrast, no other inhibitory KIR-HLA pairs showed an
               association with the two mosquito-borne arboviruses. CONCLUSION:
               These observations are strongly suggestive that the NK cell
               repertoire shaped by the KIR2DL1:HLA-C2 interaction facilitate
               specific infection by CHIKV.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Lassa virus (LASV) is the etiologic agent of an
               acute hemorrhagic fever endemic in West Africa. Natural killer
               (NK) cells control viral infections in part through the
               interaction between killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors
               (KIRs) and their ligands. LASV infection is associated with
               defective immune responses, including inhibition of NK cell
               activity in the presence of MHC-class 1+-infected target cells.
               METHODS: We compared individual KIR and HLA-class 1 genotypes of
               68 healthy volunteers to 51 patients infected with LASV in
               Sierra Leone, including 37 survivors and 14 fatalities. Next,
               potential HLA-C1, HLA-C2, and HLA-Bw4 binding epitopes were in
               silico screened among LASV nucleoprotein (NP) and envelope
               glycoprotein (GP). Selected 10-mer peptides were then tested in
               peptide-HLA stabilization, KIR binding and polyfunction assays.
               FINDINGS: LASV-infected patients were similar to healthy
               controls, except for the inhibitory KIR2DL2 gene. We found a
               specific increase in the HLA-C1:KIR2DL2 interaction in
               fatalities (10/11) as compared to survivors (12/19) and controls
               (19/29). We also identified that strong of NP and GP viral
               epitopes was only observed with HLA-C molecules, and associated
               with strong inhibition of degranulation in the presence of
               KIR2DL+ NK cells. This inhibitory effect significantly increased
               in the presence of the vGP420 variant, detected in 28.1\% of
               LASV sequences. INTERPRETATION: Our finding suggests that
               presentation of specific LASV epitopes by HLA-C alleles to the
               inhibitory KIR2DL2 receptor on NK cells could potentially
               prevent the killing of infected cells and provides insights into
               the mechanisms by which LASV can escape NK-cell-mediated immune
               pressure.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Human Ebola infection is characterized by a
               paralysis of the immune system. A signature of $\alpha$$\beta$ T
               cells in fatal Ebola infection has been recently proposed, while
               the involvement of innate immune cells in the
               protection/pathogenesis of Ebola infection is unknown. Aim of
               this study was to analyze $\gamma$$\delta$ T and NK cells in
               patients from the Ebola outbreak of 2014-2015 occurred in West
               Africa, and to assess their association with the clinical
               outcome. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Nineteen Ebola-infected
               patients were enrolled at the time of admission to the Ebola
               Treatment Centre in Guinea. Patients were divided in two groups
               on the basis of the clinical outcome. The analysis was performed
               by using multiparametric flow cytometry established by the
               European Mobile Laboratory in the field. A low frequency of
               V$\delta$2 T-cells was observed during Ebola infection,
               independently from the clinical outcome. Moreover, V$\delta$2
               T-cells from Ebola patients massively expressed CD95 apoptotic
               marker, suggesting the involvement of apoptotic mechanisms in
               V$\delta$2 T-cell loss. Interestingly, V$\delta$2 T-cells from
               survivors expressed an effector phenotype and presented a lower
               expression of the CTLA-4 exhaustion marker than fatalities,
               suggesting a role of effector V$\delta$2 T-cells in the
               protection. Furthermore, patients with fatal Ebola infection
               were characterized by a lower NK cell frequency than patients
               with non fatal infection. In particular, both CD56bright and
               CD56dim NK frequency were very low both in fatal and non fatal
               infections, while a higher frequency of CD56neg NK cells was
               associated to non-fatal infections. Finally, NK activation and
               expression of NKp46 and CD158a were independent from clinical
               outcome. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCES: Altogether, the data suggest
               that both effector V$\delta$2 T-cells and NK cells may play a
               role in the complex network of protective response to EBOV
               infection. Further studies are required to characterize the
               protective effector functions of V$\delta$2 and NK cells.",

               syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the
               coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), exhibit a wide spectrum of
               disease behaviour. Since DNA methylation has been implicated in
               the regulation of viral infections and the immune system, we
               performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify
               candidate loci regulated by this epigenetic mark that could be
               involved in the onset of COVID-19 in patients without
               comorbidities. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained
               from 407 confirmed COVID-19 patients $\leq$ 61 years of age and
               without comorbidities, 194 (47.7\%) of whom had mild
               symptomatology that did not involve hospitalization and 213
               (52.3\%) had a severe clinical course that required respiratory
               support. The set of cases was divided into discovery (n = 207)
               and validation (n = 200) cohorts, balanced for age and sex of
               individuals. We analysed the DNA methylation status of 850,000
               CpG sites in these patients. FINDINGS: The DNA methylation
               status of 44 CpG sites was associated with the clinical severity
               of COVID-19. Of these loci, 23 (52.3\%) were located in 20
               annotated coding genes. These genes, such as the inflammasome
               component Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) and the Major
               Histocompatibility Complex, class I C (HLA-C) candidates, were
               mainly involved in the response of interferon to viral
               infection. We used the EWAS-identified sites to establish a DNA
               methylation signature (EPICOVID) that is associated with the
               severity of the disease. INTERPRETATION: We identified DNA
               methylation sites as epigenetic susceptibility loci for
               respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. These candidate
               biomarkers, combined with other clinical, cellular and genetic

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The diversity in the clinical course of COVID-19 has
               been related to differences in innate and adaptative immune
               response mechanisms. Natural killer (NK) lymphocytes are
               critical protagonists of human host defense against viral
               infections. It would seem that reduced circulating levels of
               these cells have an impact on COVID-19 progression and severity.
               Their activity is strongly regulated by killer-cell
               immuno-globulin-like receptors (KIRs) expressed on the NK cell
               surface. The present study's focus was to investigate the impact
               of KIRs and their HLA Class I ligands on SARS-CoV-2 infection.
               METHODS: KIR gene frequencies, KIR haplotypes, KIR ligands and
               combinations of KIRs and their HLA Class I ligands were
               investigated in 396 Sardinian patients with SARS-CoV-2
               infection. Comparisons were made between 2 groups of patients
               divided according to disease severity: 240 patients were
               symptomatic or paucisymptomatic (Group A), 156 hospitalized
               patients had severe disease (Group S). The immunogenetic
               characteristics of patients were also compared to a population
               group of 400 individuals from the same geographical areas.
               RESULTS: Substantial differences were obtained for KIR genes,
               KIR haplotypes and KIR-HLA ligand combinations when comparing
               patients of Group S to those of Group A. Patients in Group S had
               a statistically significant higher frequency of the KIR A/A
               haplotype compared to patients in Group A [34.6\% vs 23.8\%, OR
               = 1.7 (95\% CI 1.1-2.6); P = 0.02, Pc = 0.04]. Moreover, the
               KIR2DS2/HLA C1 combination was poorly represented in the group
               of patients with severe symptoms compared to those of the
               asymptomatic-paucisymptomatic group [33.3\% vs 50.0\%, OR = 0.5
               (95\% CI 0.3-0.8), P = 0.001, Pc = 0.002]. Multivariate analysis
               confirmed that, regardless of the sex and age of the patients,
               the latter genetic variable correlated with a less severe
               disease course [ORM = 0.4 (95\% CI 0.3-0.7), PM = 0.0005, PMC =
               0.005]. CONCLUSIONS: The KIR2DS2/HLA C1 functional unit resulted
               to have a strong protective effect against the adverse outcomes
               of COVID-19. Combined to other well known factors such as
               advanced age, male sex and concomitant autoimmune diseases, this
               marker could prove to be highly informative of the disease
               course and thus enable the timely intervention needed to reduce
               the mortality associated with the severe forms of SARS-CoV-2
               infection. However, larger studies in other populations as well
               as experimental functional studies will be needed to confirm our
               findings and further pursue the effect of KIR receptors on NK
               cell immune-mediated response to SARS-Cov-2 infection.",

               occurrence and development of COVID-19. DNA of blood samples
               from 257 COVID-19 patients were extracted and used to detect KIR
               and HLA-C gene frequencies using single strain sequence-specific
               primer (SSP) PCR. The frequency of these genes was compared
               among 158 individuals with mild COVID-19, 99 with severe
               disease, and 98 healthy controls. The frequencies of KIR2DL2
               (P=0.04, OR=1.707), KIR2DS3 (P=0.047, OR=1.679), HLA-C1C1

               OR=2.126) were significantly higher in the COVID-19 patients
               than the healthy controls. At the same time, the frequency of
               KIR2DL3+KIR2DL2-/HLA-C1+Others+ was lower in COVID-19 patients
               than in healthy individuals (P=0.004, OR=0.477). These results
               suggest that the protective effect of KIR2DL3 against SARS-CoV-2
               infection is related to the absence of the KIR2DL2 gene. This
               study found no correlation between the frequencies of these
               genes and COVID-19 pathogenesis. Global statistical analysis
               revealed that the incidence of COVID-19 infection was higher in
               geographic regions with a high frequency of KIR2DL2. Together
               these results suggest that the KIR2DL2/HLA-C1C1 gene pairing may
               be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe
              illness including cytokine storms, but mortality among countries
              differs largely. In the present study, we investigated the
              association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I, which
              plays a major role in susceptibility to viral infections, and the
              mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: data of allele frequencies of
              HLA-A, -B and -C and COVID-19 mortality were obtained for 74
              countries from the Allele Frequency Net Database and
              worldometer.info. Association between allele frequency of each
              HLA and mortality was assessed by linear regression followed by
              multivariable regression. Subsequently, association of HLA-C*05
              to its receptor KIR2DS4fl, expressed on natural killer (NK)
              cells, and differential mortality to historic pandemics were
              analyzed. RESULTS: HLA-A*01, -B*07, -B*08, -B*44 and -C*05 were
              significantly associated with the risk of deaths (adjusted p =
              0.040, 0.00081, 0.047, 0.0022, 0.00032, respectively), but only
              HLA-C*05 remained statistically significant (p = 0.000027) after
              multivariable regression. A 1\% increase in the allele frequency
              of HLA-C*05 was associated with an increase of 44 deaths/million.
              Countries with different mortality could be categorized by the
              distribution of HLA-C*05 and its receptor KIR2DS4fl, which in
              combination cause NK cell-induced hyperactive immune response.
              Countries with similar ethnic and/or geographic background
              responded in a similar pattern to each pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: we
              demonstrated that allele frequency of HLA-C*05 and the
              distribution pattern with its receptor KIR2DS4fl strongly
              correlated with COVID-19 mortality. Host genetic variance of
              innate immunity may contribute to the difference in mortality
              among various countries and further investigation using patient

              Observational and prospective study. SETTING: Eight Intensive
              Care Units (ICU) from 6 hospitals of Canary Islands (Spain).
              PATIENTS: COVID-19 patients admitted in ICU and healthy subjects.
              INTERVENTIONS: Determination of HLA genetic polymorphisms. MAIN
              VARIABLE OF INTEREST: Mortality at 30 days. RESULTS: A total of
              3886 healthy controls and 72 COVID-19 patients (10 non-survivors
              and 62 survivor patients at 30 days) were included. We found a

              after controlling for SOFA (OR=7.693; 95\% CI=1.063-55.650;
              p=0.04) or APACHE-II (OR=11.858; 95\% CI=1.524-92.273; p=0.02),
              the allele HLA-C*01 after controlling for SOFA (OR=11.182; 95\%
              CI=1.053-118.700; p=0.04) or APACHE-II (OR=17.604; 95\%
              CI=1.629-190.211; p=0.02), and the allele HLA-DQB1*04 after
              controlling for SOFA (OR=9.963; 95\% CI=1.235-80.358; p=0.03).
              CONCLUSIONS: The new finding from our preliminary study of small

               symptoms in the ZOE COVID app (previously known as the COVID
               Symptoms Study App). Eligible participants were aged 16-99
               years, based in the UK, with a body-mass index between 15 and 55
               kg/m2, had received at least two doses of any SARS-CoV-2
               vaccine, were symptomatic, and logged a positive symptomatic PCR
               or lateral flow result for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period.
               The primary outcome was the likelihood of developing a given
               symptom (of the 32 monitored in the app) or hospital admission
               within 7 days before or after the positive test in participants
               infected during omicron prevalence compared with those infected
               during delta prevalence. FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2021, and Jan
               17, 2022, we identified 63 002 participants who tested positive
               for SARS-CoV-2 and reported symptoms in the ZOE app. These
               patients were matched 1:1 for age, sex, and vaccination dose,
               across two periods (June 1 to Nov 27, 2021, delta prevalent at
               >70\%; n=4990, and Dec 20, 2021, to Jan 17, 2022, omicron
               prevalent at >70\%; n=4990). Loss of smell was less common in
               participants infected during omicron prevalence than during
               delta prevalence (16·7\% vs 52·7\%, odds ratio [OR] 0·17; 95\%
               CI 0·16-0·19, p<0·001). Sore throat was more common during
               omicron prevalence than during delta prevalence (70·5\% vs
               60·8\%, 1·55; 1·43-1·69, p<0·001). There was a lower rate of
               hospital admission during omicron prevalence than during delta
               prevalence (1·9\% vs 2·6\%, OR 0·75; 95\% CI 0·57-0·98, p=0·03).
               INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of symptoms that characterise an
               omicron infection differs from those of the delta SARS-CoV-2
               variant, apparently with less involvement of the lower
               respiratory tract and reduced probability of hospital admission.

               structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been
               determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the
               billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is
               bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort
               required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate
               computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to
               enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the
               three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based
               solely on its amino acid sequence-the structure prediction
               component of the 'protein folding problem'8-has been an
               important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite
               recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of atomic
               accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available.
               Here we provide the first computational method that can
               regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even
               in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an

               version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that
               incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein

               examining asymptomatic infection provides a unique opportunity
               to consider early immunological features that promote rapid
               viral clearance. Here, postulating that variation in the human
               leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci may underly processes mediating
               asymptomatic infection, we enrolled 29,947 individuals, for whom
               high-resolution HLA genotyping data were available, in a
               smartphone-based study designed to track COVID-19 symptoms and
               outcomes. Our discovery cohort (n = 1,428) comprised
               unvaccinated individuals who reported a positive test result for
               SARS-CoV-2. We tested for association of five HLA loci with
               disease course and identified a strong association between
               HLA-B*15:01 and asymptomatic infection, observed in two
               independent cohorts. Suggesting that this genetic association is
               due to pre-existing T cell immunity, we show that T cells from
               pre-pandemic samples from individuals carrying HLA-B*15:01 were
               reactive to the immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 S-derived peptide
               NQKLIANQF. The majority of the reactive T cells displayed a
               memory phenotype, were highly polyfunctional and were
               cross-reactive to a peptide derived from seasonal coronaviruses.
               The crystal structure of HLA-B*15:01-peptide complexes
               demonstrates that the peptides NQKLIANQF and NQKLIANAF (from
               OC43-CoV and HKU1-CoV) share a similar ability to be stabilized
               and presented by HLA-B*15:01. Finally, we show that the
               structural similarity of the peptides underpins T cell
               cross-reactivity of high-affinity public T cell receptors,

               The effects of COVID-19 differ substantially not just between

               different ancestries. In humans, the human leukocyte antigen

               an important role in determining susceptibility to infectious

               SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or disease course in COVID-19 in
