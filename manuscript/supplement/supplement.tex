\caption{Scatter plots showing results of multiple linear regression predicting patient SOFA score. Regressors include total predicted (A) HLA-A, (B), HLA-B, and (C) HLA-C binding interactions for each patient toward their corresponding SARS-CoV-2 peptidome. Patient (D) age, (E) BMI, and (F) sex are also included as regressors in the analysis., Error bars represent standard deviation in the independent variable across binding probability thresholds.}\label{fig:2}

\caption{Dose dependence of HLA-C allele subtypes with respect to patient SOFA score. (A-B) Violin plots showing dependence of patient SOFA score on number of alleles in each of the two HLA-C KIR clusters. (C) Bar graph showing the correspondence of the sequence-based clusters identified in the present study to the previously determined KIR clusters. (D-F). Violin plots showing the dependence of patient SOFA score on number of HLA-C alleles from each of the three sequence-based clusters. }\label{fig:3}

%%% If you are submitting a figure with subfigures please combine these into one image file with part labels integrated.
%%% If you don't add the figures in the LaTeX files, please upload them when submitting the article.
%%% Frontiers will add the figures at the end of the provisional pdf automatically
%%% The use of LaTeX coding to draw Diagrams/Figures/Structures should be avoided. They should be external callouts including graphics.
